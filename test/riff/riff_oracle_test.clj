  "Conformance against ffmpeg, in both directions.

   The portable suite reads recorded reference files. What only a shell can add is
   the other direction — **ffmpeg decoding a file we wrote** — and the check that
   matters most for a PCM writer: converting both the reference file and ours to
   the same raw format and comparing the bytes. A header field at the wrong offset
   survives our own reader and fails in every other tool.

   Skipped loudly when ffmpeg is missing."
